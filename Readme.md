Hi the aim of this repository is to create a working dialog system along with classifiers that are required to make it possible

1a Text classification
    We used for methods for text classification majority base line, rule based base line and two machine learning algorithms (Logistic reggression,Descsion Tree)

    Results of the classifiers

    1) Majority based: Accuracy .40
    2) Rule based: Accuracy .68
    3) Logistic regression: Accuracy .98
    4) Decision Tree: Accuracy .98
